Wordle Clone
Practicing basic OOP concepts and Java by creating a clone of the popular game Wordle

This project was done as part of a personal project to learn programming. All the files labled testDrivers were used to individually test the classes Board, ToDoWithWords, and GameLogic.

Running instructions(for mac):
1. Clone the repository onto a directory.
2. Type "java Game" into terminal
3. Follow the instructions and enjoy! :)
